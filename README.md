# Golden-section-Search-Algorithm
This repository contains the implementation of the Golden Section Search algorithm in Python. The Golden Section Search algorithm is a method for finding the minimum of a unimodal function within a specified interval. It is an optimization algorithm that iteratively narrows down the search interval by dividing it according to the golden ratio.
